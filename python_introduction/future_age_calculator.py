#Practice receiving user input in Python and perform a simple arithmetic operation to calculate the user’s age in a future year.
# Ask the user for their current age and calculate their age in 2050

# Prompt user input
current_age = int(input("How old are you? "))

# Calculate age in 2050
age_in_2050 = current_age + 27  # 2050 - 2023 = 27

# Print result
print("In 2050, you will be", age_in_2050, "years old.")
